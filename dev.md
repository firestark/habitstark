## Habits

Adding habits can be a bit complex. Before we can add a habit we need to have some type of goal. This is a wanted obstacle though so we need to make this as smooth as possible.
Secondly the habit levels can be a bit confusing.

Restrict to max twice a week. This is not a daily, right now we can not check wether we have completed it.


Levels can be weird for simple habits like: eat carrots. What levels should we add here?
